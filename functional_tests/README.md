Lightblue - Functional tests
=====================

This document aims to give an overview of the tests


How the functional tests works
-------------------------------------------------------

You need to install http://gatling-tool.org/ in your machine and start the gatlingâ€™s recorder (which will be a simple proxy you need to inform you browser or system that will capture the HTTP(S) requests and turn into test code). Then you can use any web tool you want (such as cURL, web browser, etc) and in the end copy to this folder to make it available to everyone.

There are some arguments you can pass to gatling (see the Gatling.scala class for more details) to avoid the interative mode. You can also set the Jenkins Gatling plugin to put that in to the build workflow that can run after the project build and generate the Gatling reports. The last link demostrate a groovy code which can run after Gatling task to validate the Gatling log, to make sure that every request worked fine (the output and the HTTP code, for example).

You can use the data from https://github.com/lightblue-platform/lightblue/tree/master/docs/demo to simulate and test how the tools work and then create the official test.
